# COM322 - Computer Vision

This repository has all my work for the **Computer Vision** class at Connecticut College, taught by [Ozgur Izmirli](https://www.conncoll.edu/directories/faculty-profiles/ozgur-izmirli/)

The class covers the basics of Computer Vision and focuses on creating a strong foundation. It consists of weekly labs, occasional homework assignments, and a midterm, all in MATLAB. The final project is open-ended, and I implemented it in Python.
